# My website

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
  <img src="public/icon.svg" alt="site icon" style="width: 100;" />
</div>

Here there will be package documentation to whatever extent I can manage

## Current bugs and workarounds

- `VictorMonoNerdFont` is slightly bigger than the other fonts, hence the links are used to be 17px

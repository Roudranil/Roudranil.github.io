## What did I make it with?

So I am not a web developer by trade or by training. A large reason why setting up this static site was even possible was becuase of [Astro](https://astro.build/). I tried with some others before, and my previous site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

A few reasons for my switch to Astro:
- Much higher degree of customisability as offered by Hugo; one of the primary roadblocks I faced with Hugo was adding styles and modifying the content rendered by the markdown files. Using layouts in Astro and `typography` in tailwind greatly simplifies that.
- Documentation - The Astro docs is one of the most detailed docs I have seen till date, and contained information on about every single problem I encountered.

## Integrations

However the dev experience wouldn't have been complete without integrations - a css framework and some other features which are markdown centric.

### TailwindCSS



### Markdown and MDX

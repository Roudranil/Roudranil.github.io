## What did I make it with?

So I am not a web developer by trade or by training. A large reason why setting up this static site was even possible was becuase of [Astro](https://astro.build/). I tried with some others before, and my previous site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

A few reasons for my switch to Astro:
- Much higher degree of customisability as offered by Hugo; one of the primary roadblocks I faced with Hugo was adding styles and modifying the content rendered by the markdown files. Using layouts in Astro and `typography` in tailwind greatly simplifies that.
- Documentation - The Astro docs is one of the most detailed docs I have seen till date, and contained information on about every single problem I encountered.

## Integrations

However the dev experience wouldn't have been complete without integrations - a css framework and some other features which are markdown centric.

### TailwindCSS

I opted for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to streamline styling and ensure a consistent design throughout the site. Needless to say, the utility classes really made it easy to write and style with css.

### Markdown and MDX

For content creation, I leveraged MDX along with remark-math and rehype-katex for mathematical expressions.

## Colorscheme

Choosing a colorscheme was a no brainer. I opted for the [Catppuccin mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) colorscheme, ocassionally patching in colors (different shades using some online tools), and some colors from catppuccin latte.

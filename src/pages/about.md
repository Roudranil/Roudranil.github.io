## Introduction

I am Roudranil Das, a masters student of data science at the **Chennai Mathematical Institute**. I did my bachelors in mathematics from the **St. Xavier's College, Kolkata**.

I am primarily interested in all sorts of practical applications of ML to solve interesting problems. Specifically I am interested in solving accessibilty problems for people with disabilities with ML. Besides, I have a keen interest in the audio and music domain and its intersection with AI.

Besides I am also a musician! I have been playing the mandoling for the past 6 years now, with specialities in Bengali folk music and retro songs. I also play the banjo and the melodica.

I am an open source enthusiast and a hobbyist linux user. Click [here](/stuff) to view all my nerdy stuff (WIP!).

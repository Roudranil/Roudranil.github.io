## Introduction

Hey there! I'm Roudranil Das, a master's student of data science at the Chennai Mathematical Institute. I completed my bachelor's in mathematics from St. Xavier's College, Kolkata. Currently, I am working as a data scientist in the Data Science and Innovation team at Kantar Analytics Practice.

I am primarily interested in all sorts of practical applications of ML to solve interesting problems, specifically in solving accessibility problems for people with disabilities using ML. I also have a keen interest in the audio and music domain and its intersection with AI.

Besides my professional interests, I'm a musician and have been playing the mandolin for the past 6 years, specializing in Bengali folk music and retro songs. I also play the banjo and the melodica. As an open-source enthusiast and hobbyist Linux user, I enjoy tinkering with my Linux rice. Click [here](/stuff) to view all my nerdy stuff (WIP!).
